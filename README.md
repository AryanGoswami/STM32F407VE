Description:
This repository contains a collection of experiments conducted using the STM32F407VE 
microcontroller. Each experiment includes a C code file (.c) demonstrating specific 
functionalities.

Contents:
ADC.c: Code for Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) operations
DC Motor using PWM.c: Code for controlling a DC motor using Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)
LED using TIMER.c: Code for controlling an LED using a timer
LED.c: Code for basic LED control
Seven Segment.c: Code for interfacing and controlling a seven-segment display
Ultrasonic Sensor.c: Code for interfacing and using an ultrasonic sensor

Usage:
Set Up Development Environment: Ensure you have a suitable development environment set up for 
STM32 microcontrollers, such as STM32CubeIDE.
Import Projects: Import the individual C files into your development environment and configure the 
project settings accordingly.
Build and Run: Compile and run the code to observe the desired functionality.
